# Minesweeper Mania

Welcome to Minesweeper Mania! This C++ program brings the classic single-player puzzle game Minesweeper to your terminal. With intuitive controls and customizable difficulty levels, you can enjoy hours of strategic gameplay.

## How to Use the Program:

1. Upon starting the program, you'll be presented with a main menu offering several options.
2. Choose 'Play' to start a new game, 'Help' to view instructions, or 'Exit' to leave the game.
3. If you choose 'Play', you'll be prompted to select a difficulty level: Easy, Medium, Hard, or Custom.
4. In Custom mode, you can specify the grid size and number of mines.
5. During the game, you'll be able to open cells, flag or unflag cells as mines, or return to the main menu.

## How to Play the Game:

1. The game grid consists of cells, some of which contain mines.
2. Your goal is to uncover all cells that do not contain mines.
3. To uncover a cell, select 'Open a cell' and enter the row and column numbers of the cell you want to reveal.
4. If the cell you open contains a mine, you lose the game.
5. If the cell does not contain a mine, it will display a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it.
6. Use the numbers to strategically uncover safe cells.
7. You can flag cells that you suspect contain mines to prevent accidentally opening them.
8. To flag or unflag a cell, choose 'Flag/Unflag a cell' and enter the row and column numbers.
9. Continue uncovering cells and flagging mines until all non-mine cells are revealed.
10. If you successfully uncover all safe cells without hitting any mines, you win the game!

## Remember:

- Be cautious when opening cells, as hitting a mine ends the game.
- Use logic and deduction to determine the locations of mines.
- Pay attention to the numbers displayed in uncovered cells to help identify safe moves.

## Results and Evaluation

Overall, the program's functionalities have been evaluated as successful and well-functioning. During testing, the program consistently met all expected outcomes without encountering any errors or bugs.

### Challenges Faced:

#### Object Oriented Programming Structure:

Initially, we planned a complex OOP structure with multiple classes for game and land objects. However, managing individual objects for each cell became inefficient as the grid size increased. We simplified the structure by utilizing 2D arrays, improving efficiency.

#### void openCell(int x, int y) Method:

Implementing the recursive opening of adjacent cells posed challenges due to the positioning of return statements. After several trials, we successfully resolved these errors, ensuring proper functionality.

#### Displaying the Grid:

Displaying the grid required meticulous management of indentation and spacing. Despite its simplicity, ensuring proper alignment for single and double-digit coordinates was time-consuming.

## Conclusion and Future Work

### Achievements:

- Successfully implemented all basic features of Minesweeper.
- Designed a user-friendly interface with customizable grid sizes.
- Utilized OOP principles to manage game components efficiently.

### Future Work:

- Implement multiplayer support for competitive gameplay.
- Enhance graphics and animations for a more immersive experience.
- Introduce advanced options and unique features to keep players engaged.

## Reflection on Learning
